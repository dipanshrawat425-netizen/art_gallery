### 1. Main Text
A descriptive paragraph praises nature as a gift, mentioning key elements like:
* Green trees and $\underline{\text{flowers}}$
* **Shining birds**
* Flowing rivers and high mountains
* The peace offered by fresh air and the sky's colors at sunrise/sunset.

### 2. Image Gallery
The page includes five sections of "creativity," each featuring an image related to nature:
* A **forest/lands** (`HTML.jpeg`)
* **Flowers** (`HTML 1.jpeg`)
* The **sun** (`HTML2.jpg`)
* **Animals** (`HTML4.jpg`)
* **Birds** (`HTML5.jpeg`)

***Note:** The images are linked via local file paths (`HTML.jpeg`, `HTML 1.jpeg`, etc.) and will not display correctly unless those image files are present in the same directory.*

### 3. Hyperlink
